## About the Site üöÄ
MetaCrypto is a cutting-edge website dedicated to providing the latest information on top 100 cryptocurrencies. The project has been designed with the user-experience in mind, and it is equipped with Firebase for Google authentication, and the Coinbase API, which provides a wealth of information about the crypto market. The responsive table on the site shows cryptocurrency data in a clear and organized format, and the custom pagination feature makes it easy to navigate. One of the standout features of MetaCrypto is the ability to see how a particular coin is performing over different periods, such as 24 hours, 90 days, and 1 year, which is presented in a graphical format for easy comprehension. The user profile section gives users the ability to keep track of their favourite coins by adding or removing them from their watchlist, and there is a proper logout section.
